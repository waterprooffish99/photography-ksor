A static site renders every governed document at a route derived from its path,
with the governance it declares.

## What a page carries

Under each title the page shows the facts the document declares about itself —
who owns it, when it took effect — and lists every source it came from at the
foot, one entry per source, so a citation can point at exactly one of them.

### A status appears only when it is a caveat

A draft or a withdrawn document says so. An approved one shows nothing, because
a reader already assumes a document in the record is current, and a label that
never varies stops being read.

#### A withdrawn document names its successor

Supersession runs both ways: the retired document points at what replaced it,
and the current one names what it replaced. Nothing is deleted.

## The record without the site

Nothing here is authored in the site. Delete the site and the record is intact —
it is CommonMark in a folder, readable in any editor.
