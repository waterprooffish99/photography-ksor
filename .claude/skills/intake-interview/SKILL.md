name: intake-interview
description: The first conversation with the owner of this Knowledge System of Record — three questions that define what it is authoritative for, who may read it and who may approve it, then write instance.md together. Use when the owner asks to set up, configure, or "get started with" this project, when instance.md still contains its scaffold placeholder text, or when the scope of the corpus is unclear.

# Intake interview

`instance.md` is the identity of this Knowledge System of Record, and its
prose IS the agent surface's system prompt (`ksor serve` wires it into the MCP
server's instructions). Do not draft it from guesses — interview the owner, one
question at a time, and write down what they actually say.

## Ask THREE questions, one at a time

Ask them in the OWNER's words, not this project's. The vocabulary on this page
— record, corpus, abstention, governance act — is precise and it is ours; an
owner meeting it for the first time in a question cannot answer, and says so
(reported 2026-08-26, against the wording these replaced: "the corpus wins
about ___" asked them to complete a sentence that is not English unless you
already know the ledger analogy).

Ask exactly this much. Do not explain what the answer will be used for inside
the question — that is what made the last version unanswerable.

---

**1 of 3 — What is this knowledge base about?**

> Be specific enough that I would know what does NOT belong in it.
>
> Too vague: "our engineering docs" — I still could not tell what to leave out.
> Specific enough: "our leave, expense and conduct policies, current versions
> only."

---

**2 of 3 — What is close to that, but not part of it?**

> Things people will ask this and it should NOT answer. A confident wrong
> answer is worse than "I do not cover that."
>
> For the policies example: "not salaries, not individual HR cases, not last
> year's versions."

---

**3 of 3 — Who signs off on a document, and who can take one down?**

> Names or handles, not job titles. If it is just you, say so.
>
> Ask for BOTH: the handle the record will store (`human:bashiraziz`) and the
> natural name to print ("Bashir Aziz"). They are not derivable from each other
> — `human:ciso` and `human:mjs` are not anybody's squashed full name — so the
> handle goes into the frontmatter and the policy, and the pair goes into
> `.ksor/people.yaml` for the site to print.

Follow up until each is concrete, but follow up in their words too: "what would
someone actually ask this?" gets further than "name the boundary".

**Why these three and no others.** The first two give the record an EDGE, and
the abstention gate is meaningless without one: a knowledge base that is
authoritative for everything has no outside, so an agent asked something the
owner never wrote about reaches for its training instead of declining. The
third cannot be guessed at all — the scaffold ships `human:you` in both
authority lists, and a placeholder that survives this conversation is a person
who was never there. Everything else has a sane default, and defaults are
stated rather than asked.

## Then STATE the defaults; do not ask them

Show these as a block, say they are defaults, and invite a correction. Do not
walk them one at a time — they are near-constant, and asking makes the
interview feel like a form.

|           | default                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| read by   | people and agents both                            |
| declines  | firmly — "not in this corpus" is a correct answer |
| audiences | one, `public` — every reader sees every document  |
| sources   | none yet — the corpus is still the samples        |

Each is written only if the owner does not object, and the write-back names
which were answered and which were defaulted. **Never report a default as an
answer.** Two answered and four defaulted is an honest sentence; "all seven
answered" is not, and it is what happened the first time this skill ran.

**If the owner says NOT every reader sees every document**, then and only
then: register each audience in `.ksor/governance.yaml` under `audiences:`
with a one-line `description:` of who is in it — `public` is reserved and
never registered. There is no ranking and no default: a document lists the
audiences that may read it, a reader holds a list that always includes
`public`, and the document is visible when the two lists OVERLAP. Tell them
what this does and does not do: builds are made per audience, but anyone who
can clone the repository reads everything in it — if someone must not read a
document and can clone, that document belongs in a different repository.

## What the answers become

Scope and Boundary become the BODY of `instance.md`, which `ksor serve` wires
into the MCP server's instructions — so it is read by every agent that
connects, and vague prose there is vague instructions everywhere.

Authority becomes `approval_authorities` and `takedown_authorities` in
`.ksor/governance.yaml`. Names, not roles-in-the-abstract: the checker refuses
an approval or a takedown by anyone the policy does not name. An actor is
`human:<handle>`, `process:<name>` or `<producer>/<version>`; handles are
published with the record, so use the handle the owner would put in a commit,
never an email address.

## Then write

- Rewrite `instance.md` from the answers. `title:` is the record's
  **display title**, the human name every page leads with ("Acme Operations
  Handbook", not the slug); `description:` is one sentence, and it seeds
  `llms.txt` and the MCP discovery document; the BODY is the authority
  sentence, boundary, audience and strictness — plain prose, handed in full
  to every connecting agent as the MCP server's instructions, so write it
  for a reader who must act on it. There is no `# H1`: the title is a key.
  Leave `name:` and `toolchain:` alone. One block is added here only when
  the owner stands up the served MCP rung — `database:`/`embedding:`/
  `retrieval:` (see `AGENTS.md` → "Serving to agents"; that is a later
  climb, not part of this interview). The `declines` default above (or the owner's
  correction to it) is the intent behind the `retrieval.vector_floor` on that
  climb, measured by `ksor calibrate` — capture it in the prose now so it is
  ready.
- Write `.ksor/governance.yaml` from question 3: `version: "0.1"`,
  the `audiences:` registry if there is one, and the two authority sets with
  real actors. That file is the root of authority — every approval, every
  deprecation and every ledger entry is checked against it. **Keep
  `ksor-starter/0.0.60` in `approval_authorities` while any starter
  document is still in `knowledge/`.** Those five are approved by it, so a
  policy rewritten without it refuses the next build by name
  (`ksor-approver-unauthorised`). It leaves when the last sample does.
- **Re-attribute what `human:you` already did.** If any document carries
  `human:you` as its approver, generator or deprecator — the hello-world
  tutorial's own document does — rewrite those acts to the owner's handle in
  the SAME change that retires the placeholder from the policy. It is the same
  person. A policy that stops naming `human:you` beside a document that still
  cites it turns a green record red (`ksor-approver-unauthorised`), and the
  owner's first act after being interviewed should not be a refusal.
- Write `.ksor/people.yaml` from question 3: `version: "0.1"` and a `people:`
  MAP from each actor to its natural name — `"human:bashiraziz": Bashir Aziz`.
  Keyed by the actor exactly as the record stores it, quoted because it
  contains a colon. Nothing else — the site looks the actor up at render time,
  so pages read "Owner · Bashir Aziz" instead of "Owner · human:bashiraziz". This
  is the skill that writes actors into the policy, so it is the one that asks
  the owner for a natural name for each — the owner is the only source of a
  display name, never a convention-based guess. An actor that arrives later
  (an owner named in a document, an approver added by hand) gets its entry
  when the owner adds one; the site prints the identifier until then.
- **Offer to start replacing the starter documents — they are already
  published.** All five ship `status: stable`, approved by
  `ksor-starter/0.0.60`, so the site and `llms.txt` carry them from
  the first build. They describe KSoR itself rather than the owner's
  organisation. Say it plainly: "Five sample documents about KSoR are published
  on your record right now. The tool that wrote them approved them — nobody has
  reviewed them, which is what the _unverified_ tier on each page says. Shall we
  start replacing them with yours?" Replacing means deleting the sample and
  writing a real document at `status: draft`; the owner approves it afterwards,
  and that act is theirs. When the last sample is gone, delete
  `ksor-starter/0.0.60` from `approval_authorities` in the same
  change — nothing of theirs should be approved by a tool. Never record an
  approval nobody gave, and never write a `verified` entry: the approval is not
  a review, and inventing one would retire the tier that exists to say nobody
  has checked this.
- Run `ksor build` afterwards: it regenerates every folder's `index.md` from
  the new title and refuses anything the profile does not accept.
- Restart `pnpm dev` afterwards so the site picks the new title up, and
  show the owner their name on the page.
- Offer to start on the owner's own documents: the add-sources skill takes
  whatever material they have from there.
- Read the result back to the owner and get an explicit yes before
  finishing. Their words, tightened — never your invention.
