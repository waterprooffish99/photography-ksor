//
// What "load-bearing" means here: numbers (with their separators — 10,000 and
// 10000 are different claims about the source), dates, codes, and runs of two
// or more capitalised words (a name). Matched case-folded and with whitespace
// collapsed, because an extraction shouts its headings and wraps its lines.
//
// What this proves, and no more: a token that PASSES is present in the source.
// A token that FAILS was changed or introduced — either way, look at it. It
// cannot tell a paraphrase from an invention, and it cannot see a value that
// was dropped. It is a floor under model-driven conversion, which is highest
// fidelity for layout and lowest for exact values (issue #31).
//
// Plain Node, no dependencies, safe to copy: `.agents/skills/` is the owner's.
