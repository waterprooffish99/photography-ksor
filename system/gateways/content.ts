/**
 * The default registration — and the ORIGINAL of the file `ksor init` emits.
 *
 * This is the canonical half of decision 18's mechanism, applied to the agent
 * surface: one rule, two places, asserted rather than trusted. The scaffold's
 * `system/gateways/content.ts` is this file byte-for-byte below the import
 * block, and `default-gateway-drift.test.ts` fails on the line that diverges.
 *
 * Two places rather than one is forced, not chosen. Node refuses to type-strip
 * any `.ts` under `node_modules` — `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`,
 * with no flag to lift it — so the published package cannot import its own
 * emitted template as a fallback. The compiled twin is how a deleted file still
 * serves, and the drift test is what stops the twins disagreeing.
 *
 * Everything below the import block is what an adopter owns: tool names, titles,
 * what the record says it covers, input schemas, annotations, and which tools
 * exist at all. What it composes — handlers, output schemas, and the FLOOR text
 * — stays in the package, because those are the citation and abstention
 * guarantees and a hand-written handler is the one thing no shape check catches.
