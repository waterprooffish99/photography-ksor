 * withdrawn figure, so a reader can take the wrong number out of the results
 * without ever opening the page (research/site-design.md F3).
 *
 * Composed from the shell's own exported primitives rather than rebuilt: the
 * only difference from the default dialog is the `Item` renderer. The status
 * is NOT written into the search index — that would put a label inside the
 * record's own titles, which the site does not author. It travels as a map of
 * route → status, built on the server, and is applied at render time.
