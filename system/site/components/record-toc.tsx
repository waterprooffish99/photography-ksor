 * cost the server render: that context is filled in an effect, so the exported
 * HTML would ship an empty rail where it currently ships every anchor. A

/**
 * "On this page", tracking where the reader actually is.
 *
 * The shell's own rail marks a heading active when 90% of it is visible
 * ANYWHERE in the viewport (`AnchorProvider` watches with `{ threshold: 0.9 }`
 * and no `rootMargin`), and then highlights whichever became active most
 * recently. On a long page that reads fine. On a governed record it does not:
 * these documents are short-sectioned, so several headings sit on screen at
 * once and the one entering from the BOTTOM wins — the marker ran two to four
 * headings ahead of the reader (measured 2026-08-22: reading "owner" while the
 * rail marked "description").
 *
 * The observer options are not configurable and the observer itself is not
 * exported, so the selection cannot be corrected from outside — only replaced.
 * This is the supported seam for that: `DocsPage`'s `slots.toc.main`. The
 * shell's provider and its small-screen popover are kept exactly as they are;
 * only the rail's choice of "here" is ours.
 *
 * The rule: the active heading is the LAST one whose top has passed the reading
 * line — which is what a person means by "the section I am in". Nothing below
 * the line can be it, however visible it is.
