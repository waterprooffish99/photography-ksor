/**
 * What a reader can DO with this document, behind one control.
 *
 * Opening the markdown twin and handing it to an agent are different acts, and
 * a reader who wants the second should not have to perform the first — but two
 * bare controls sitting on a row of read-only facts made the row look half
 * clickable. One trigger says "there are actions here" once, and the menu says
 * what they are.
 *
 * Putting the markdown LINK behind a click is safe for the audience that reads
 * bytes: `generateMetadata` already advertises the twin as
 * `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` in the head, so a crawler and
 * an agent find the address without opening anything. Verified in the built
 * HTML before this moved.
