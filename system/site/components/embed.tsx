 * frame the reader loads by asking. The click is not politeness — the
 * scaffold's browser test asserts ZERO external requests on a built page, and
 * that guarantee is what makes this record work offline, behind a firewall,
 * and without telling a third party which document someone is reading. An
 * always-on frame would break it on every page carrying one.
 *
 * Two things the panel says out loud, because they are the reason for the
 * click. It NAMES the host, so a reader consents to a party rather than to a
 * button. And it says the page is not part of the record: an embed carries no
 * provenance claim, cannot be cited, and can change under the document without
 * anyone reviewing it. The link out is always there and costs nothing, because
 * a plain `<a>` is not a request.

 * built for do exactly that, and clicking one moved the page 5,807px (found
 * live).
 *
 * The call still does its real job inside the frame; only the part that moved
 * the host is undone, in the same task, so nothing is painted in between.
