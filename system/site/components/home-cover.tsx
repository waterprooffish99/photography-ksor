 * the dark not white but the surface that catches the light. Every colour on it
 * is a `--ksor-cover-*` token, so the whole composition inverts with the theme
 * rather than staying dark in both, and the accent inverts with it.
 *
 * The record's own words on the left, the record ITSELF on the right — the
 * document it opens on, and the entries standing behind it. That stack is
 * where this page spends its boldness; everything around it is deliberately
 * quiet.
