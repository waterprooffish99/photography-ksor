 * The chrome every page of the record wears: the governed tree as a sidebar,
 * search, and the record's own identity at its foot.
 *
 * The FRONT DOOR wears it too. A system of record whose first page hides the
 * record behind a marketing layout makes a reader click before they can see
 * what is in it; the docs homes of AI-first projects put their first page
 * inside this same shell (modelcontextprotocol.io redirects to a document,
 * Cursor's `/docs` renders one — both checked 2026-08-22). One shell, defined
 * once: two copies of it drift, and the drift shows up as a sidebar that
 * disagrees with itself between two routes.
