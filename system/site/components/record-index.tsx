/**
 * What the record holds below this point.
 *
 * The site renders the record; this renders its shape. Every value comes from
 * the record — title, description, status, owner and the count below an entry
 * are frontmatter and tree, and the order is the governed `order:` key — so
 * nothing is authored in the site (critical rule 1).
 *
 * It exists because a folder's index page listed nothing: `/docs/policies`
 * rendered a title, a sentence and then empty space, while the two policies it
 * contains were reachable only from the sidebar. The home page had the same
 * gap — it said "5 documents" and linked to one (research/site-design.md F2/F5).
 *
 * Each entry is a CARD, not a hairline row (owner, 2026-08-22, choosing it from
 * four prototyped treatments). The register the design language called for was
 * honest about hierarchy and silent about being usable: at rest a row carried
 * no affordance at all — only a hover tint and a hover colour — so on a touch
 * screen, where there is no hover, nothing ever said the row was a link. A card
 * is a surface a reader expects to press, and the arrow says where pressing
 * leads before anyone has moved a pointer.
 *
 * What survives from the register is the part that was never about looks: the
 * record's serif for its own words, mono for what the record says ABOUT them —
 * who owns it, how much it holds, whether it carries a caveat — and `stable`
 * staying silent, because a label on every row is a label nobody reads.
 *
 * Server-rendered plain markup — it survives print, a failed bundle and
 * JavaScript off, like every other governance fact.
