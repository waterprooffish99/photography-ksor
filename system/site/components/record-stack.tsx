/**
 * The record on the cover, as a body of documents rather than a diagram of one.
 *
 * The front door used to carry an illustration of the product's claim — one
 * governed source projecting into its surfaces. Four of them were drawn and all
 * four were rejected (owner, 2026-08-22), and the reason is worth keeping: a
 * stock drawing is the ONE thing on this page that can never be true of the
 * adopter's corpus. Every KSoR would ship the identical picture, and it would
 * say nothing about the record behind it.
 *
 * So the picture is made of the record. The document `Open the record` opens
 * leads, fully set — its own title, its own words, its own governance — and the
 * record's next entries stand behind it with depth. A record of one document
 * and a record of two hundred therefore get visibly different front doors,
 * which is the point: what is on the cover is what is in the volume.
 *
 * Nothing here is authored (scaffolded AGENTS.md, critical rule 1): every
 * string is a title, description, owner or status the record declares, or a UI
 * label. The depth is CSS, so it costs no image and follows the theme.
