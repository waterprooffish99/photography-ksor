/**
 * The two READINGS of one document: the record's own words, and its summary.
 *
 * Study aids are NOT here. A deck — and the quiz that will sit beside it — is
 * something you do AFTER reading, so it belongs at the end of the page rather
 * than behind a tab that hides the document while you use it. See
 * components/study-aids.tsx.
 *
 * PRESENCE-DRIVEN. With neither attachment there is no tab strip at all — not a
 * disabled tab, not a greyed affordance, not an empty panel. A control that
 * cannot do anything is worse than no control, and a governed record whose
 * documents mostly have no study attachments would otherwise grow a row of dead
 * chrome on every page.
 *
 * EVERY PANEL IS IN THE SERVER-RENDERED HTML, hidden rather than unmounted.
 * The panels arrive as props — React elements built on the server — so an agent
 * parsing the page, a crawler, and a reader whose bundle failed all get the
 * text. A summary that only exists once JavaScript runs is a summary missing
 * from the printout, which is the same argument governance.tsx makes for
 * rendering governance as plain markup.
