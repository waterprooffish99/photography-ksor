/**
 * Mechanical hygiene checks for a quiz, run before it can be published.
 *
 * Carried from the predecessor's `scripts/quiz-audit/` under decision 6, and
 * carried because of what its own README records: these bugs SHIPPED and were
 * found by students rather than by the project — every correct answer at
 * position A across 9 quizzes and 451 questions, explanations dismissing their
 * own marked answer, and the correct option systematically the longest. Its
 * `findings-2026-04-14.txt` still reports 88% pick-longest in one file, which
 * is the argument for running this in the build instead of on request: the
 * script existed, and the findings sat.
 *
 * What is NOT carried is its thresholds. It targets a 15-35% distribution,
 * which a five-question bank cannot satisfy without the checker dictating the
 * answers. These are floors against the shipped bug, not a distribution target
 * — see MIN_BANK_FOR_RATIOS.
 *
 * Verified against the predecessor's real data before shipping (2026-08-23):
 * run over the 18 parsed questions of its `11-chapter-quiz.md`, this reports
 * 67% of answers at option C and 78% pick-longest — both real, both shipped,
 * and both the exact class its README says students found rather than the
 * project. A rule that fires only on fixtures would not have earned this.
 *
 * A LEAF: no imports, so the site's build and the record's checker can both
 * hold this rule without either taking the other's dependencies.
