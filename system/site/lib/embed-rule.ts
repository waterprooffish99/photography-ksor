/**
 * An interactive page the document points at, as a CLICK-TO-LOAD frame.
 *
 * A record often wants to show something running — a simulation, a dashboard,
 * a player — at one exact point in the prose. A deck is one per document and
 * lives in an attachment (`<doc>.slides.yaml`); this is the other shape: many
 * per document, each where the sentence before it puts it.
 *
 * The form is an ordinary CommonMark link whose TITLE is the word `embed`:
 *
 *     [Play run-until-done](https://example.org/sims/goal-loop "embed")
 *
 * Chosen the way the alert syntax was chosen — for what it does everywhere the
 * record is read that is NOT this site. GitHub renders a link with a tooltip.
 * `/md/` and `llms-full.txt` carry the author's link. A plain editor shows a
 * link. No grammar is added to `knowledge/`, so critical rule 2 holds.
 *
 * The TITLE, rather than a lone link on its own line, because the opt-in has
 * to be something an author WROTE. A rule that reframes any link standing
 * alone would silently pull a third party's page into the record the first
 * time someone put a citation on its own line.
 *
 * REHYPE, not remark, for the reason `alert-rule.ts` records: this record's
 * markdown is serialized from the mdast, so rewriting there would publish this
 * site's React component to the agent surface in place of the author's link.
 *
 * A LEAF: no imports, so the rule can be tested on its own.

 * checker decides which files are admitted at all and this file only decides
 * which links become a frame — one rule, two readers. The definition is
 * repeated here rather than imported to keep this file a LEAF (above), which
 * is not a preference: a relative import here needs `./sim-rule.js` under the
 * package's node16 typecheck and `./sim-rule` under the site's bundler, and
