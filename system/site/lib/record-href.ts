/**
 * What a link inside a document names, as a route of THIS build.
 *
 * OKF §6.1 allows two forms and the record spec (§2.3) carries both:
 * bundle-absolute (`/policies/x.md`, resolved against `knowledge/`) and
 * relative (`x.md`, `./x.md`, `../x.md`, against the document's own
 * directory), with `.md` optional in each. The shell resolves only the `./`
 * and `../` forms (fumadocs-core 16.15.4, `resolveHref` returns anything else
 * untouched), so a bundle-absolute link left the record's frame entirely and a
 * bare `x.md` was resolved by the browser against the page's ROUTE rather than
 * its directory: both 404'd from every page, found live 2026-08-25 as prefetch
 * failures in the console.
 *
 * So the record's OWN resolver decides — `resolveLink` is the same function the
 * checker uses for the widening rule, which is what makes a link the checker
 * accepted a link this site can serve.
 *
 * Pure, and the whole decision, so it is testable without a site install
 * (packages/ksor/src/record-href.integration.test.ts).

import { resolveLink } from "../record/citations";

/**
 * `href` as this build serves it: a route when the link names a concept of this
 * build, and the author's own text otherwise.
 *
 * Otherwise the href is handed back UNCHANGED, which is what carries assets,
 * external urls and same-page anchors through untouched.
 *
 * Two cases fall through to a link this build cannot serve, and both are
 * deliberate. A per-viewer build stages a SUBSET, so a link to a concept this
 * viewer may not see must not be rewritten — inventing a route would publish
 * the existence of a document the viewer was not given, which is exactly what
 * the audience rule withholds. And a link to a concept that exists in no build
 * is an authoring mistake the CHECKER owns: rewriting it here would hide it
 * from the one thing that can name the file and the line.
