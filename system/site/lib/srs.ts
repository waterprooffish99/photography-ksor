/**
 * Review scheduling for flashcard decks.
 *
 * A two-grade SM-2 variant. It is NOT FSRS, it models no memory, and it makes
 * no retention guarantee — see `SCHEDULER_POLICY` and the note at the foot of
 * this file. Naming it for what it is costs nothing and stops a future reader
 * assuming a probabilistic guarantee that was never here.
 *
 * A LEAF and a pure function: `(schedule, rating, now) -> schedule`. No React,
 * no storage, no ambient clock — `now` is always passed in, which is what makes
 * the whole transition table assertable against a frozen clock.

/**
 * What this gives up against FSRS, recorded beside the code rather than in a
 * document that can drift from it:
 *
 *  1. No memory model. `ease` is a heuristic multiplier with no probabilistic
 *     meaning; it cannot answer "how likely is recall today".
 *  2. Elapsed time is ignored — the largest single loss. FSRS feeds
 *     retrievability into every update, so a card recalled sixty days late
 *     earns a much larger interval. Here the interval grows the same whether
 *     the review was on time or a year late.
 *  3. No retention target. FSRS derives intervals to hit a requested
 *     retention; "roughly 90%" is a sentence this is not entitled to.
 *  4. No optimisation. FSRS re-fits parameters per learner; these are
 *     constants, identical for everyone.
 *  5. No graded lapse recovery — a flat half-interval and a flat ease penalty,
 *     whatever the card.
 *  6. Four grades reduced to two, which costs nothing: the UI never exposed
 *     Hard or Easy, so no information that was ever collected was discarded.
