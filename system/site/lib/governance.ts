// A concept carries the profile's governance (record spec §2) — status, type,
// `ksor.owner`, `sources`, `ksor.effective_from`, `stale_after`,
// `ksor.superseded_by`, the approval and the verifications — and this module
// is the one projection of those keys the pages and the agent surfaces share.
// Provenance is load-bearing: a reader has to be able to see who stands behind
// a document and where it came from, or the site is showing them prose while
// the agent surface answers with citations.
//
// Free of VALUE imports on purpose: this is the pure half, so it is unit-tested
// directly (packages/ksor/src/site-governance.test.ts) without a site install.
// Anything needing the Fumadocs loader — resolving a successor to its route —
// lives outside it.
//
// The one import is a TYPE, and it alone carries the `.js` that the package's
// Node-ESM program wants, while every other module here is extensionless
// because Turbopack resolves neither form onto a `.ts` file. `import type` is
// erased before any bundler sees it, so the two rules never meet on this line.
