/**
 * What makes a file in the record an ATTACHMENT rather than a document.
 *
 * A document may carry study attachments named after it — `x.summary.md` and
 * `x.flashcards.yaml` belong to `x.md` in the same directory. An attachment is
 * PART OF its parent: no route, no sidebar entry, no llms.txt line, no stable
 * id, no MCP node, and its parent's governance rather than its own.
 *
 * This rule is duplicated by construction — the kernel's ingest decides what
 * becomes a node, the site's staging decides what is copied, the site's build
 * decides what is a page, and the record's checker decides what is well-formed.
 * Four readers of one rule is exactly the shape decision 18 names, so this file
 * is canonical and every other copy is asserted against it rather than trusted.
 *
 * A LEAF: no imports, so any of those four can take it without taking anything
 * else with it.
