 * The audience rule, alone, with no imports and no side effects.

 * CANONICAL COPY: `packages/content/src/lib/audience-rule.ts`. The scaffold's
 * site carries a byte-identical copy at
 * `system/site/lib/audience-rule.ts`, and `audience-rule-drift.test.ts`
 * fails if the two ever differ. The site cannot simply import the kernel: its
 * lib is deliberately dependency-light and runs inside Next's build, while the
 * kernel package carries pg and the embedding providers.
 *
 * Why the rule gets its own file at all: the site and the kernel enforce the
 * same visibility rule in two languages — TypeScript here, SQL in
 * `audience.ts` — and it drifted four separate times while each side's own
 * tests stayed green, because each side was internally consistent with itself.
 * `AUDIENCE_CASES` is the shared decision table both are asserted against, and
 * this file is the shared implementation of the TypeScript half.
