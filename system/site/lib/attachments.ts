 * Both collections are keyed by their record-relative path (fumadocs'
 * `info.path`), which is the same shape as a page's own `page.path` — so the
 * lookup is a suffix swap, not a second index to keep in step. `x.md` finds
 * `x.summary.md` and `x.flashcards.yaml`, and nothing else can be reached.
 *
 * Neither collection is ever handed to `loader()`, which is what keeps an
 * attachment off the route table, the sidebar, llms.txt, llms-full.txt, the
 * markdown twin and the search index — see source.config.ts.
