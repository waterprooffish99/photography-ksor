/**
 * Serve the STATIC EXPORT, so the build has somewhere to land.
 *
 * The site is `output: "export"` — there is no server to start, which is what
 * makes the record hostable anywhere. But it also means the `start` script
 * every other project has does not exist here, and running one is the first
 * instinct after a build; the package manager then reports a missing script,
 * which explains nothing about why there is nothing to start.
 *
 * So this is the answer to "and now how do I look at it". It is node:http and
 * nothing else — no dependency to install and no network fetch, so it works
 * offline and behind a firewall, for the same reason the build itself
 * downloads nothing.
 *
 * Names no package manager on purpose: this file ships in the npm and bun
 * scaffolds too, and those must not carry another manager's vocabulary
 * (asserted by `init-manager.integration.test.ts`).
 *
 * It is a PREVIEW, not a deployment: single process, no compression, no
 * caching headers. Put the directory behind a real web server or a static
 * host for anything else.

 * Stream a file, and answer honestly when it cannot be read.

 * uncaught exception, which is how a malformed URL used to end this process.
 * `statSync().isFile()` in `resolve()` does not make the later `open()` safe:
 * the file can go between the two, and it does, in the ordinary loop this
 * command exists for — the adopter leaves `preview` running and rebuilds in
 * another pane, the export is torn down and rewritten, and an asset the open
 * page re-requests is gone (`ENOENT`). A mode-000 file anywhere in the export
 * is the same crash with no timing at all (`EACCES`, reproduced).
 *
 * The head is written on 'open', NOT before it. Writing it first meant an
 * unreadable file answered `200` with an empty body and a valid terminating
 * chunk — a complete, successful response carrying nothing, which a browser
 * renders as a blank page and `fetch().text()` reports as `""`. That is the
 * same silent lie this file exists to stop telling, moved one layer down.
 * Once the head IS out there is no status left to send, so a failure part way
 * through destroys the socket instead of ending it cleanly: a truncated
 * response is what the client must see, because it is what happened.
