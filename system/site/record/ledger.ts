 * denying too much is the recoverable half and denying too little is a leak.

 * denial that covers one document too many is recoverable and one that covers
 * one too few is a leak, so the unreachable case denies.

 * was deleted and then re-written from whatever the caller happened to have

 * acts and both reported success (measured: five concurrent runs, five claims,
 * three entries), and a reader landing inside the truncation window read an
 * empty ledger and rewrote forty entries down to one.
 *

 * bytes at the end whatever else is happening, so the file only ever grows,
 * a killed writer leaves what was already there, and the worst a LOST lock can
 * do is order two acts differently — not lose one.
 *

 * the header is written. A file that does not end in a newline gets one first,
