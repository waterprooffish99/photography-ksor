/**
 * The record module as one surface (record spec §6; decision 26): the
 * profile, the control files, the checker, the lock and the leaf rules — and
 * nothing that touches a database or a provider. Published as the
 * `@panaversity/ksor-content/record` subpath so the emitted checker bundles
 * exactly this and not the kernel behind it (the first build that took the
 * package root carried pg-pool into an adopter's `pnpm check`).
