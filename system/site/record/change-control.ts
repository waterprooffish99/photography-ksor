/**
 * KSP R23 — the first verification tooth in approval.
 *
 * A `stable` concept's `generated.at` dates its TEXT, and `ksor.approval.at`
 * ratifies the text of that date. Until now the checker compared the two
 * authored instants and nothing else (`ksor-generated-after-approval`), so
 * whether an edit actually moved `generated.at` was the author's obligation:
 * change a sentence, leave the stamp, and the approval that ratified the old
 * sentence reads as ratifying the new one, with nothing red. This module
 * compares the body in the working tree against every committed version of
 * the same path that was `stable`, and refuses `ksor-generated-stale` when a
 * body differs under a `generated.at` the tree has not ADVANCED past — equal,
 * or moved backward, which changes the stamp without advancing it. Only the
 * body: a frontmatter-only
 * edit — a `verified` entry, a re-approval — is not a change to the text the
 * stamp dates.
 *
 * What it does NOT verify, and says so: who reviewed anything. R22 and R25
 * need an identity the platform can vouch for, and `approval.checked` stays
 * `"policy"` (decision 21). This is the one rule in the record module that
 * reads git, so it sits beside `git-ledger.ts` and is run by the two
 * publishing verbs — `ksor build` and `ksor ingest` — each of which SAYS when
 * history could not be read rather than passing a check that did not run. The
 * emitted `check.mjs` does not run it: that is the format gate an agent runs
 * after every edit, and a stamp is verified where the record is published.
