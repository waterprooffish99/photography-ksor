 * so `mostSpecific` skips the rule entirely, and `types: []` fails every
 * `includes` for the same effect. An empty list reads as "everywhere" and
 * means "nowhere" — on `approval_authorities` that refuses the concept and
 * fails safe, but on `ownership` it resolves to the same `null` as "no rule
 * binds this", and deprecation authority then falls back to the document's own
 * self-declared `owner:` (2026-08-25 review).
 *
 * The empty MAPPING is the opposite direction and the same silence: `scope: {}`
 * scores depth 0 and matches EVERY concept, which is the state the one-letter
 * `path:` typo produced before the key set was closed. It is the one route to
 * that widening a closed key set cannot catch, so it is refused here — the
 * record-wide fallback is written by omitting `scope`, and a rule that names a
